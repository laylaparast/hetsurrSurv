`hetsurrSurv` is an `R` package to assess and test for heterogeneity in the utility of a surrogate marker with respect to a baseline covariate using censored (survival data), and to test for heterogeneity across multiple time points.    

More details on the method are available in Parast, L., Tian, L & Cai, T. (2024). Assessing Heterogeneity in Surrogacy Using Censored Data. Statistics in Medicine, 43(17): 3184-3209, [doi:10.1002/sim.10122](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.10122).
